                <div class="news-summary">What was meant to be a triumphant pre-season tour through Asia for FC
                    Barcelona turned into a chaotic saga of last-minute cancellations, legal threats, and an urgent
                    financial bailout that nearly derailed the club’s global brand efforts</div>

                <div class="news-title">The Build-Up: A High-Stakes Tour</div>
                <div class="news-summary">Barcelona’s 2025 summer tour was set to reestablish their international
                    footprint after years of financial restructuring. The club announced a series of friendly matches in
                    Japan and South Korea, with major fixtures including:

                    July 27 – vs. Vissel Kobe (Japan)

                    July 31 – vs. FC Seoul (South Korea)

                    August 4 – vs. Daegu FC (South Korea)

                    With Marcus Rashford freshly signed, and the renovated Camp Nou still under construction, the tour
                    was a vital opportunity for global fan engagement and commercial exposure.</div>

                <div class="news-title">Sudden Collapse: The Kobe Cancellation</div>
                <div class="news-summary">Just three days before the Kobe match, Barcelona canceled their trip to Japan,
                    citing a “serious contractual breach”. The breach was traced to Yasuda Group, a Japanese promoter
                    tasked with handling logistics and financial guarantees. According to club sources, Yasuda failed to
                    transfer between €5–8 million, which Barcelona considered critical for match operations, player
                    logistics, and insurance.

                    As a result, Barça pulled out of the match, canceled their outbound flight, and instructed players
                    to remain in Barcelona—prompting confusion and outrage among Japanese fans and organizers.</div>
                <a href="news.html" style="color:#A50044">Back to News</a>
                <div class="news-title">The Fallout: Blame and Legal Threats</div>
                <div class="news-summary">The backlash was immediate. Albert Luque, representing D‑Drive (Barcelona’s
                    Asian tour partner), blamed Yasuda Group for “breaching multiple financial agreements” and announced
                    plans for legal action. In a press conference, Luque labeled the situation “an embarrassment,”
                    adding that Barça had every right to protect itself financially.

                    Fans in Japan, who had already purchased match tickets and merchandise, expressed frustration on
                    social media, with local media questioning how such a premier club could be caught in what looked
                    like amateur-hour logistics.

                    Meanwhile, Spanish media outlets criticized Barcelona’s own administrative handling of the
                    situation, with Cadena SER calling the entire episode “a disaster of coordination” and warning that
                    it “tarnished Barça’s global image.”</div>

                <div class="news-title"> The Rescue: Rakuten Steps In</div>
                <div class="news-summary">In a stunning twist, former Barça shirt sponsor Rakuten reportedly stepped in
                    to save the tour. According to multiple sources, Rakuten—keen to maintain its relationship with the
                    club—fronted or facilitated the required payment to Yasuda Group or directly to cover Barça’s
                    financial demands.

                    By July 25, less than 48 hours after the cancellation, Barça reinstated the match against Vissel
                    Kobe, rebooked their travel plans, and confirmed that Rashford and the squad would travel to Japan.

                    The friendly was back on. Barcelona departed for Kobe immediately, and the remainder of the Asia
                    tour schedule remained unchanged.</div>

                <div class="news-title">What This Means for the Club</div>
                <div class="news-summary">While the team avoided a public relations disaster, the incident revealed the
                    fragile nature of Barcelona’s financial and operational foundations. Despite a world-class brand,
                    the club is still recovering from heavy debts and remains extremely dependent on sponsors,
                    promoters, and licensing agreements to sustain major events like these.

                    Additionally, the episode raised questions about due diligence and whether club leadership had
                    vetted Yasuda Group adequately. It also underscored how tight Barcelona’s margins are—unable to risk
                    even a few million in lost payments without canceling high-profile fixtures.</div>

                <div class="news-title">Rashford’s Debut and Moving Forward</div>
                <div class="news-summary">Amid the chaos, Marcus Rashford’s debut became a beacon of hope. The English
                    forward was able to join training in Kobe and is expected to make his first appearance for the club
                    in the July 27 match against Vissel. Club president Joan Laporta later stated, “The situation was
                    unfortunate, but the team is focused and united. Rashford is already making a strong impression.”

                    Barça’s Asia tour will continue into South Korea, with matches against FC Seoul and Daegu FC,
                    helping the club regain momentum and attention after the early misfire.</div>

                <div class="news-title">Final Thoughts</div>
                <div class="news-summary">What began as a PR disaster for FC Barcelona turned into a cautionary tale of
                    modern football’s dependence on third-party promoters and razor-thin financial planning. While
                    Rakuten’s intervention salvaged the trip, the episode should serve as a wake-up call for the club’s
                    leadership.

                    Barcelona survived the crisis—but barely.</div>
