# Barca Web VT

Welcome to **Barca Web VT**, a dedicated website for FC Barcelona fans. This project aims to provide a comprehensive and engaging platform where supporters can stay updated with the latest match fixtures, explore detailed player profiles, and catch up on the newest club news. Built using HTML and CSS, the website focuses on delivering a clean, responsive design that works seamlessly across both desktop and mobile devices.

The website features several key pages, including a main landing page that introduces the club and its legacy, a fixtures page listing upcoming matches, a news section highlighting recent announcements and updates, and a player profiles section showcasing information about the current squad. Additionally, the site contains detailed articles to provide deeper insights into specific events or stories related to FC Barcelona.

To get started with the project locally, clone the repository from GitHub using the command below. After cloning, navigate into the project folder and open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser to explore the site. The project folder is organized so that HTML files are grouped by content, and all media assets such as images are stored in a dedicated folder to keep everything neat and manageable.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vidhaan-fcb/barca-web-vt.git
cd barca-web-vt
```

The website emphasizes a user-friendly interface with intuitive navigation and interactive elements such as hover effects to enhance the browsing experience. Its responsive design ensures that fans can enjoy the content whether they’re on a desktop, tablet, or smartphone.
