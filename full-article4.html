                <div class="news-title">Pau Víctor Joins Braga in €15M Deal</div>
                <div class="news-summary">Just two seasons after lighting up Spain’s third tier as Barcelona Atlètic’s
                    top scorer, 22-year-old Pau Víctor has completed a stunning transfer to Portuguese side SC Braga in
                    a deal that’s shattered club records and triggered widespread reaction across Iberian football. The
                    transfer—announced on July 25—sees Víctor sign a five-year deal through 2030, with Braga paying a
                    guaranteed €12 million to FC Barcelona and potentially another €3 million in performance-related
                    add-ons. The total package makes Víctor the most expensive player in Braga’s history, surpassing
                    their recent €13 million outlay on Mario Dorgeles.

                    Víctor’s journey to Portugal has been rapid and unexpected. After scoring 20 goals in 39 games for
                    Barça Atlètic during the 2023–24 season, he was promoted to the senior squad under new manager Hansi
                    Flick. However, despite flashes of promise, he struggled for consistent minutes, featuring in 29
                    matches but logging only 372 minutes—averaging less than 13 minutes per appearance. His modest tally
                    of 2 goals and 1 assist didn't reflect his potential, and with competition fierce and Barcelona
                    needing financial flexibility, the club opted to cash in.

                    The move also provides Barcelona with an important financial buffer. With Financial Fair Play (FFP)
                    regulations looming over their summer transfer activity, Pau Víctor’s sale reportedly unlocked
                    around €8 million in FFP margin. However, due to a prior agreement with Girona—his former
                    club—Barcelona will receive only about 70% of the fixed €12 million fee. Girona had retained 30% of
                    the player’s economic rights when he transferred to Barcelona, giving them a significant windfall
                    from the deal. This arrangement has become increasingly common in Spanish football, particularly for
                    young players moving between domestic clubs.

                    Sources close to the negotiations revealed that Víctor’s exit was handled swiftly once Braga
                    submitted their formal offer. The player underwent medical exams in Portugal just days before the
                    announcement and was given an in-depth tour of Braga’s facilities. He was formally presented as a
                    Braga player on the club’s official website and will wear the number 18 shirt heading into the
                    2025–26 season. Club officials described him as a “long-term investment,” and coach Carlos Vicens is
                    expected to integrate him immediately into their European qualification campaign.

                    The release clause in Víctor’s new contract stands at €50 million—a clear signal from Braga that
                    they intend to protect their investment. This figure reflects both the club’s faith in his long-term
                    potential and their anticipation that larger clubs may come knocking if he fulfills the promise he
                    showed in Spain. At just 22 years old, Víctor still has time to grow into a high-level European
                    striker, and Braga is betting heavily on his development.

                    Born in Sant Cugat del Vallès, Pau Víctor came up through the youth systems of Sabadell and Girona,
                    eventually making his professional debut for Girona at 18. A productive loan spell at Sabadell
                    followed, where he netted seven goals in the 2022–23 campaign. But it was during his loan to
                    Barcelona Atlètic that his star truly rose—becoming one of the standout players in Spain’s Primera
                    RFEF. Despite initial hopes he might break into Barcelona’s long-term plans, the arrival of new
                    attacking signings and limited senior opportunities changed the club’s course.

                    Reaction among fans has been mixed. While Braga supporters have welcomed the arrival of a young and
                    proven goal-scorer, many Barcelona fans expressed disappointment at seeing a La Masia-developed
                    forward sold so soon, especially after his breakout season. Critics also questioned whether the club
                    maximized his value, considering the 30% cut owed to Girona and the relatively low minutes he
                    received at the senior level.

                    For Pau Víctor, this move is more than a transfer—it’s a reset. At Braga, he will have the
                    opportunity to lead the line in a top-tier European league, play consistent minutes, and feature in
                    continental competitions. For Braga, it’s a bold bet on youth and attacking talent. And for
                    Barcelona, it’s yet another balancing act in a summer defined by financial maneuvering.

                    As preseason wraps up and competitive matches loom, all eyes will be on Víctor to see if he can live
                    up to the price tag—and become the star Braga believe he can be.
