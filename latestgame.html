                On July 31, 2025, FC Barcelona played FC Seoul in an exciting pre-season friendly at the Seoul World Cup
                Stadium, marking the club's return to South Korea after more than 15 years. The match was part of
                Barça’s Asian summer tour and ended in an emphatic 7–3 win for the Catalan giants, showcasing their
                attacking firepower and deep squad. Barcelona started with a strong lineup that included Lewandowski,
                Pedri, Raphinha, and 17-year-old sensation Lamine Yamal, who wore the iconic No. 10 shirt and delivered
                a brilliant performance. Yamal scored twice in the first half, one of which came after a stunning
                dribble and finish, while Lewandowski opened the scoring by tapping in a rebound. Although FC
                Seoul—currently fourth in the K League and featuring veteran Jesse Lingard—responded with two goals, one
                ruled out for offside, they couldn’t maintain control for long. The first half ended 3–2 in favor of
                Barcelona, but the real story unfolded after halftime when coach Hansi Flick substituted all eleven
                players, bringing in younger talents and bench players.

                The second half saw Barcelona’s depth take over. Andreas Christensen blasted in a long-range rocket,
                Gavi scored with a composed finish, and Ferran Torres added two more goals to seal a comprehensive win.
                Despite the hot and humid conditions, Barça maintained their pace and fluidity, with the second-half
                squad displaying energy and intent. FC Seoul showed resilience and managed a third goal late on, but
                were ultimately overwhelmed by Barça’s precision and tactical execution. This match not only highlighted
                the depth of Barcelona’s squad but also confirmed the readiness of several young and fringe players to
                contribute during the season. Yamal’s performance stood out as the most electrifying, underlining his
                potential as a future leader of the team. For FC Seoul, the match offered valuable exposure and moments
                of promise, particularly from Lingard and their high pressing in the first half. Overall, the game
                served as a successful showcase for Barcelona’s evolving squad under Flick, offering fans a glimpse of a
                team blending youth, experience, and attacking brilliance ahead of the upcoming campaign.
